# CPE 315 Lab 1 -- Piku

## Things to include in your README

* Name: Archita Sahijpal. Sometimes I go by Archie!
* I have completed the lab! 
* Compilation and execution instructions
  * `gcc -o piku piku.s`
  * `./piku`
* I initially tried to store each string in its own register and it would result in a seg fault when I tried to call printf on it. I was wondering why that was the case? 

These README files have a fairly rich _Markdown_ environment. You should use
markdown syntax to format your README files in such a way that they look
professional, and are easy to read. Use the 
[Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and
have fun! :octocat:
